1. To build and test the code, clone the project locally on your computer, and then in the manager-devices folder, write npm install in the terminal
or console,then, after installing the node modules, write npm run dev and npm run nodemon. Then open localhost:3100
2. This application also uses server data. if you want to test the user interface, in main.js comment: lines 109-118 and 290-325, then uncomment code: lines 331-364 and 122
3. Also application does not have tests and TypeScript, because this is my next challenge:)
