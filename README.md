Under correction... Now you can only watch code, whithout start project

/*
1. This application uses server data. If you want to test the user interface:
  - clone the project locally on your computer
  - in main.js comment: lines 112-119 and 295-330, then uncomment code: lines 336-369 and 122
  - in the technical-manager folder write npm install in the terminal or console
  - after installing the node modules write npm run dev and npm run nodemon
  - open localhost:3100
4. Also application does not have tests and TypeScript because this is my next challenge:) 
5. In future i would make refactoring, because i know i can make code better, as minimum destructuring main.js to 3-4 components-modules */
